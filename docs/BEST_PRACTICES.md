# Best Practices

Understand code patterns before reusing themâ€”ask "What problem does this solve?" and "Does this apply here?" Unit tests passing doesn't guarantee correctness or performance:

- Test with realistic workloads
- Check logs for warnings and timing issues
- Verify fixes don't introduce new problems
