# Change: Simplify README with current features

## Why

The README should be concise and focused on getting users started quickly. Detailed technical information like project structure, API endpoints, and tech stack can be found by exploring the project itself or via the OpenAPI docs.

## What Changes

- Update feature list to include all current capabilities
- Organize features into clear categories
- Keep installation and running instructions
- Keep development commands for contributors
- Remove verbose sections (tech stack, project structure, API endpoints, WebSocket events)
- Add feedback and issues section for community engagement

## Impact

- Affected specs: None (documentation only)
- Affected code: `README.md`
