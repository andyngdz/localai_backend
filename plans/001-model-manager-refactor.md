# 001: Model Manager Refactor

**Branch:** `refactor/model-manager-and-internal-logic`
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** October 2024
**Tests:** 454/454 passing

---

## Problem Statement

The original `ModelManager` class was a 485-line monolith handling multiple responsibilities:
- State management (IDLE, LOADING, LOADED, UNLOADING, ERROR)
- GPU/MPS memory cleanup
- Pipeline storage and configuration
- Async loading orchestration with cancellation

This violated the Single Responsibility Principle and made the code:
- Hard to test (tight coupling between concerns)
- Difficult to debug (too many responsibilities)
- Error-prone (race conditions, resource leaks)
- Challenging to extend (changes affected multiple concerns)

---

## Solution Approach

Refactor the monolith into a **Facade Pattern** architecture with specialized managers:

```
ModelManager (Facade - 162 lines)
├── StateManager (86 lines)         - State machine & transitions
├── ResourceManager (73 lines)      - GPU/MPS memory cleanup
├── PipelineManager (98 lines)      - Pipeline storage & config
└── LoaderService (221 lines)       - Async orchestration & cancellation
```

Each manager has a single, well-defined responsibility with clear interfaces.

---

## Architecture Changes

### Before: Monolithic Design
```python
class ModelManager:
    # 485 lines mixing all concerns
    def load_model_async()      # orchestration + state + pipeline
    def unload_model_async()    # cleanup + state + resources
    def get_state()            # state access
    def cleanup_pipeline()     # resource management
    # ... many more mixed responsibilities
```

### After: Modular Facade
```python
class ModelManager:
    """Facade coordinating specialized managers."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.state_manager = StateManager()
        self.resource_manager = ResourceManager()
        self.pipeline_manager = PipelineManager()
        self.loader_service = LoaderService(...)

    # Delegates to appropriate manager
    async def load_model_async(id):
        return await self.loader_service.load_model_async(id)
```

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. StateManager (app/cores/model_manager/state_manager.py)

**Responsibilities:**
- Manage state transitions (IDLE → LOADING → LOADED → UNLOADING → IDLE)
- Validate transitions using predefined rules
- Log state changes with reasons

**Key Features:**
- Property-based API: `@property current_state` (was `get_state()` method)
- Private state: `_state` (encapsulation)
- Class-level constant: `_VALID_TRANSITIONS` (performance)
- Explicit documentation: "NOT thread-safe, use external locking"

**Dead Code Removed:**
- `ModelState.CANCELLING` - never actually set, only checked
- 5 unused `StateTransitionReason` values

### 2. LoaderService (app/cores/model_manager/loader_service.py)

**Responsibilities:**
- Orchestrate async model loading
- Handle cancellation tokens
- Manage ThreadPoolExecutor for blocking operations
- Coordinate state transitions during load/unload

**Key Improvements:**
- Fixed race conditions (proper lock usage)
- Resource cleanup: `shutdown()` method for executor
- Clear naming: `self.state_manager` (was `self.state`)
- No variable caching: direct `self.state_manager.current_state` calls
- Always-fresh state values

**Concurrency Pattern:**
```python
async with self.lock:
    # Check state
    if self.state_manager.current_state == ModelState.LOADING:
        logger.info('Need to cancel')

# Release lock before long-running cancellation
if self.state_manager.current_state == ModelState.LOADING:
    await self.cancel_current_load()

# Re-acquire lock for state modifications
async with self.lock:
    self.state_manager.set_state(ModelState.LOADING, ...)
```

### 3. PipelineManager (app/cores/model_manager/pipeline_manager.py)

**Responsibilities:**
- Store pipeline instance and model_id
- Provide pipeline configuration
- Handle sampler updates
- Extract sample size from UNet config

**Simple, focused interface:**
```python
def set_pipeline(pipe, model_id)
def clear_pipeline()
def get_pipeline() -> Any | None
def get_sample_size() -> int
def set_sampler(sampler: SamplerType)
```

### 4. ResourceManager (app/cores/model_manager/resource_manager.py)

**Responsibilities:**
- Clean up GPU (CUDA) resources
- Clean up MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) resources
- Force garbage collection after cleanup
- Log memory metrics

**Platform-specific cleanup:**
```python
def cleanup_cuda_resources():
    torch.cuda.synchronize()
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
    gc.collect()
    logger.info(f'CUDA memory freed: {metrics}')

def cleanup_mps_resources():
    torch.mps.synchronize()
    torch.mps.empty_cache()
    gc.collect()
```

## Bugs Fixed

### Critical
1. **Resource Leak** - ThreadPoolExecutor created but never shut down
   - **Impact:** Memory leak on application shutdown
   - **Fix:** Added `shutdown()` method, integrated into `main.py` lifecycle

2. **Race Conditions** - TOCTOU vulnerabilities in state checks
   - **Impact:** State could change between check and use
   - **Fix:** Proper lock acquisition/release pattern

### Major
3. **Stale State Values** - Variable caching caused outdated checks
   - **Impact:** Logic bugs where old state values were used
   - **Fix:** Removed variable caching, use direct property access

4. **Dead CANCELLING State** - Defined but never set
   - **Impact:** Confused state machine, dead code
   - **Fix:** Removed CANCELLING and 5 related transition reasons

### Minor
5. **Pre-commit Hook** - Invalid `ruff format -- --fix` syntax
   - **Fix:** Changed to `ruff format` (auto-formats by default)

6. **Inconsistent Naming** - `self.state` vs `self.state_manager`
   - **Fix:** Renamed to `self.state_manager` throughout

7. **Encapsulation Violations** - Direct property modifications without validation
   - **Fix:** Added warnings in setters, improved validation

---

## API Changes

### Property-Based API (Breaking Changes)

**Before:**
```python
state = model_manager.get_state()
size = model_manager.get_sample_size()
```

**After:**
```python
state = model_manager.current_state
size = model_manager.sample_size
```

### Endpoint Changes

**`/models/status` response:**
```python
# Removed field (unused by frontend):
'is_cancelling': state == ModelState.CANCELLING

# Kept fields:
'state': state.value
'loaded_model_id': model_manager.id
'has_model': model_manager.pipe is not None
'is_loading': state == ModelState.LOADING
```

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

**Updating API calls:**
```python
# OLD (deprecated, still works but will warn)
state = model_manager.get_state()
size = model_manager.get_sample_size()

# NEW (recommended)
state = model_manager.current_state
size = model_manager.sample_size
```

**Accessing managers:**
```python
# Direct manager access (if needed)
model_manager.state_manager.current_state
model_manager.pipeline_manager.get_pipeline()
model_manager.resource_manager.cleanup_pipeline(pipe, id)
model_manager.loader_service.shutdown()
```

### For Frontend

**`/models/status` endpoint:**
- `is_cancelling` field removed (was always `false` anyway)
- Use `state` field to track model status
- `is_loading` field still available
